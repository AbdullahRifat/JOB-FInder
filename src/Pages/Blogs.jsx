    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens in Web Development</h1>

    <p className="text-lg font-semibold">In the world of web development and authentication, the concepts of access tokens and refresh tokens are essential to secure the communication between clients (e.g., web applications) and servers. Let's dive into what these tokens are, how they work, and where to store them on the client-side.</p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens</h2>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">What is an Access Token?</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>An access token is a piece of data that serves as a key to access certain resources or perform actions on a server.</li>
        <li>It is typically short-lived and used to authorize a user or client to access specific endpoints or data on a server.</li>
        <li>Access tokens are usually generated after a user logs in and provides valid credentials.</li>
        <li>They act as a form of authorization, confirming the identity of the user or client and granting specific permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">What is a Refresh Token?</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>A refresh token is another type of token used for obtaining new access tokens after the original one expires.</li>
        <li>Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and can be used to request new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.</li>
        <li>They are an essential part of the token-based authentication system to ensure seamless user experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">How Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens Work</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>A user logs in, and the server validates their credentials.</li>
        <li>Once validated, the server generates an access token and a refresh token.</li>
        <li>The access token is sent to the client, typically stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie or local storage.</li>
        <li>When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.</li>
        <li>This process provides a balance between security and usability, as access tokens are short-lived, limiting potential damage if they are compromised.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Where to Store Tokens on the Client-side</h2>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">Access Tokens</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Access tokens should be stored securely on the client-side.</li>
        <li>The recommended approach is to store them in HTTP-only cookies or in-memory variables.</li>
        <li>Storing them in cookies helps protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
        <li>In-memory storage is suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) but may expose tokens to potential XSS attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">Refresh Tokens</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Refresh tokens are even more sensitive, and they should be stored securely on the client-side.</li>
        <li>The recommended approach is to store them in HTTP-only cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them.</li>
        <li>This adds an extra layer of security to protect the long-lived refresh tokens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Express.js and Nest.js</h2>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">What is Express.js?</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.</li>
        <li>It simplifies building robust and scalable web applications and APIs by providing a set of features and tools.</li>
        <li>Express.js is known for its simplicity and is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">What is Nest.js?</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework that provides an opinionated structure for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications.</li>
        <li>It is built with TypeScript and takes inspiration from Angular, making it a great choice for building back-end services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Explaining the Code</h2>
    <p className="font-semibold mt-2">A React-Node.js web application is a dynamic and modern web platform that combines the power of two popular technologies: React, a front-end JavaScript library, and Node.js, a runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. React is used to create a responsive and interactive user interface, allowing for a seamless and engaging user experience. Meanwhile, Node.js serves as the back-end framework, facilitating server-side logic and data handling. This combination enables the development of high-performance web applications with real-time capabilities, making it a preferred choice for building web apps that demand interactivity and scalability. React-Node.js web apps are highly versatile and find applications in a wide range of domains, from e-commerce and social networking to content management systems and more, making them a popular choice for modern web development projects.</p>
